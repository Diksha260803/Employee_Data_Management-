# Employee_Data_Management-
In this project, an employees database is created using SQL, with a well-defined table structure that includes important attributes such as employee ID, name, gender, department, job title, hire date, salary, and email address. The employee ID serves as the primary key, ensuring that each employee record is unique and maintaining data integrity.
