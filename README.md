# Employee_Data_Management
In this project, an employees database is created using SQL, with a well-defined table structure that includes important attributes such as employee ID, name, gender, department, job title, hire date, salary, and email address. The employee ID serves as the primary key, ensuring that each employee record is unique and maintaining data integrity.The SQL Employees Data Collection Project is designed to store, manage, and analyze employee-related information using a relational database system. This project focuses on building a structured employees database that helps an organization efficiently maintain records such as personal details, department, job role, salary, and hiring date.

The project uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to create the database schema, insert data from a CSV file, and perform meaningful queries for data analysis. The main objective is to demonstrate practical knowledge of database design, data types, primary keys, and SQL operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions.

In this project, employee data is collected in a CSV file and imported into an SQL database. This simulates a real-world HR system where bulk employee data is stored and later used for reporting and decision-making. Various queries are executed to analyze employee distribution across departments, calculate average and highest salaries, track hiring trends, and retrieve specific employee information.

This project helps in understanding key database concepts such as data normalization, data integrity, and efficient data retrieval. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners and can be extended further by adding related tables like departments, attendance, or performance records.

Overall, the Employees Data Collection Project demonstrates how SQL can be used in real-world scenarios for employee management, HR analytics, and organizational data analysi
